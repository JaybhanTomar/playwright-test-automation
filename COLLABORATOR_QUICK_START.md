## ðŸŒ¿ Branch Rules

- **`master`** - Production code (protected, no direct pushes)
- **`develop`** - Integration branch (create PRs here)
- **`feature/*`** - Your feature branches
- **`bugfix/*`** - Bug fix branches

## ðŸ“ž Need Help?

1. Check `COLLABORATION_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions
2. Review existing tests in `tests/` directory
3. Ask team members for code review
4. Check GitHub Issues for known problems

## âš¡ Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Branch management
git checkout develop              # Switch to develop
